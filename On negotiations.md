###Notes on Margaret Neale's negotiations preso and videos (Harvard Business School)

- *Listen Listen Listen Listen* when negotiating.
- There is no command-and-control. *Try to influence, influence. Command and control doesn't work*.
- Tie your price to the group (yours and your counterpart) benefit.
- Ask your self: 'what am I trying to achieve with the negotiation?'
- Q: Is it better to make or receive the first offer? A: it depends. ancor your counterpart vs information you get
- Q: easy issues first? A: Bad idea!! Better negotiate at the package level, *not* at the issue level.
- Q: when do you walk away? Prepare!! What's your bottom line? What's your aspiration?

####Negotiation plan
- Collaborative vs  combative
- Assess: Goal of negotiation: get a **good** deal.
       - what are my alternatives?
       - what's my reservation price? (what's my price when a NO is as good as a YES)
       - What's an optimistic assessment of what I want to get from this negotiation - my aspiration?
- Prepare: *Prepare Prepare Prepare Prepare* before negotiation.
       - **What are my interest are?**
       - **What are my counterpart's interest?**
- Ask! Engage and share info!
- Package: negotiate a package, **not** issue by issue. Issue by issue is a battle, a package is a solution tailored to suit both parties.

**Expectations drive behaviour and outcome!**

**You said YES to every bad deal you've had**

**Set the Agenda yourself**

**Don't show them your pain. Do not show them your bottom line!**

**Reveal relative importance but not the full magnitude of that importance**

**Do not put all your cards on the table**

**Establish what you want**
